# Why?
As you may know, every previous Prestige Cr4ck had one major server issue: console spam. The reason for the console spam was an empty array that I never bothered to fix. However, since we've managed to deobfuscate the Prestige source code (which will be released soon), I've discovered new ways to crack Prestige and fix one of its biggest issues.

The reason why console spam was such an issue was because it could create log files exceeding 300 MB (no joke!).

For those of you who are still wondering why configurations aren't working, it's because of zPrestiges' acoustic configuration system. This system saves every single configuration on their servers, not on your local machine. Unfortunately, we won't be fixing this issue unless a good opportunity arises.
