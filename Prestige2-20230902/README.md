# Why?
Auth didn't get any better and zPrestige doesn't rly talk to me anymore. I also have to mention that there are still few connections related to Cloud Config so you guys can have the same experience as a buyer + There might be few other auth connections left over that shouldn't be harmful. I have mentioned this since we aren't reposinble for any damages made by Prestige Client and by downloading this jar you agree that you have taken a thought about it.
