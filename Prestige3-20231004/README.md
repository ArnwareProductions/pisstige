# Why?
Well, Well, Well... Looks like blud is lying in his Change Log since he said that Security improved but nothing changed related to Security (It's just either me being too smart or zPrestige being dumb, Ya decide).

**Disclaimer:** There might be few other auth connections left over that shouldn't be harmful. I have mentioned this since we aren't responsible for any damages made by Prestige Client and by downloading this jar you agree that you have taken a thought about it.
