# Why?
zPrestige decided to drop a new Update which used a Obfuscator called ZKM. He was really confident that ZKM will save his A$$ but as they say... Do NOT always rely on the Obfuscation.

For those of you who are still wondering why configurations aren't working, it's because of zPrestiges' acoustic configuration system. This system saves every single configuration on their servers, not on your local machine. Unfortunately, we won't be fixing this issue unless a good opportunity arises.
